# Code Quiz

## Description
This is a challenge I did for my bootcamp. I was tasked to create a quiz about code. I searched online for several questions as they were not provided by the assignment or in the starter code. Using a mix of what I was taught in classes for the last few weeks, class activities, research and discussing with friends and fellow peers, I was able to meet some of the requirements for this difficult, yet challenging assignment. I also utalised AI when I exhausted every option I could think of to point me in the right direction - though this time I found that in some cases the code would be incorrect even with some needed adjustments.
